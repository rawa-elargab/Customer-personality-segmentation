It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.</font> </p>\n\n<font size=\"4\">customers have different personalities and are spread across the various stages of sales funnel. Customers show different personalities and behavior when they are potential customers or even when you need to support them in the customer service and customer success stages. In such cases, having the same approach to handle all your customers leads to bad customer experiences. And studies show that 33% of customers leave a brand they leave just after one bad experience!!</font>\n\n<font size=\"4\">Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.</font>\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n<font size=\"4\">This dataset contains 29 variables and 2240 observations about
